week 8 node stuff

learning node for fun and profit

1.    make app.js file
2.    make food.js file
3.    on app.js: import food.js
      =>    require('./food'); <= this is referring to the file name, not the thing being exported
      on food.js: export food array
      =>    module.exports=food;
            CAN ONLY EXPORT ONE THING FROM EACH FILE
